My 32nd assignment! This assignment called for a very in-depth dive into bootstrap. As a site for a fictional tech company it needed a few things which I'll go over below.

Assignment 1  
1. Up first I created a services section with cards that show each service.  
2. I created a contact form to request a quote right below the services section.  

Assignment 2  
1. I next added a header and intro section with everything centered within. There is a banner that stretches the entire width and the company name is centered within.  
2. For the specific qualities of the company, there is a section that shows the qualities a customer should expect. Good place to put awards and such.  
3. Next, I made an about section that has a main content area that takes up 2 columns, and a side content section that occupies one column to the left. 
4. Finally, a footer with contact info, social media links and a newsletter signup form rounds everything off.
